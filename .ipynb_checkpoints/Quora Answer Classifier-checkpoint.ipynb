    "# Quora uses a combination of machine learning (ML) algorithms and moderation to ensure high-quality content on the site. High answer quality has helped Quora distinguish itself from other Q&A sites on the web.  \n",

    "Your task will be to devise a classifier that is able to tell good answers from bad answers, as well as humans can.  A good answer is denoted by a +1 in our system, and a bad answer is denoted by a -1.\n",

    "The first line contains N, M. N = Number of training data records, M = number of parameters. Followed by N lines containing records of training data. Then one integer q, q = number of records to be classified, followed by q lines of query data\n",

    "The data is extracted from real production data, and thus will not include the raw form of the answers. We, however, have extracted as many features as we think are useful, and you can decide which features make sense to be included in your final algorithm. The actual labelling of a good answer and bad answer is done organically on our site, through both human moderators as well as our own classifier.\n",
